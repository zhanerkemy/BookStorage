# BookStorage
This project is a simple backend application built with Python and FastAPI to manage a collection of books. It demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a book database. The application uses a lightweight SQLite database for storage and includes automatic validation of data using Pydantic schemas.
